1. ITerations 1 through 24 are wrong, we might as well throw them away, because there was some crappy feedback from somewhere.
   On second throught, it was probably not the feedback but the fact that the volume on the Mac wasn't up too high. 
2. Iterations 25 onwards are good, because both the volume and the potential feedback from the other machine's other microphone (which somehow turned itself on) . 



Setup :

Hari's MAC connected to the GRIFFIN iMic 
my laptop

 both on the CSAIL ethernet. 

Forced to use the GRIFFIN iMic on Hari's MAC cause the other thing didn't work. 


Anyway, conclusively, after:

1. Verifying that the period if 16/17 ms with Owen.
2. Pulling AC in and out at home and in lab. 
3. An older anecdote.

I am convinced that there is a ton of AC static if you connect it to the mains. So ditch that first. 

But even after that I need to remove some residual low amp 60 Hz signal. I am not yet sure how to do that. 


Checked like 50 % of the robustness,txt file. Seems pretty robust.  Checked all of it. Does seem robust. 


SUMMARY :

Files 1 through 25 seem useless
Files 25 through 50 seem useful and all of them have a latency of about 280 ms +/- 2 ms which is really stable.
