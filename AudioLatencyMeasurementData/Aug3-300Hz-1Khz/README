Same setup with Mac and Win7
But with Keith's background idea. 

My peak detector went haywire. Maybe I should sharpen the BPF.

Anyway, by inspection, the latency now is : 
Rx 1 :

3.132
3.025

Rx 2 :

3.08843
3.007

First bit latency : 
1.007


Rx 10 :

1.087
1.004

Aargh, now the latencies are back down to 80 ms or so. 

Damn this idiotic thing. I am not sure how to control it at all. 
 
But the rest of my measurements went haywire for some reason. 



Ok, ok, ok :

So summary for now :

1. Measurements went haywire for some stupid reason, as in the SNR isn't all that clean anymore. 
2. But, the latencies even for the prelim 300Hz signal are of the order of 80 to 100 ms and not 280 ms. 
3. My getDelay.py program, no longer works for some God forsaken reason. 

Here are some speculative conclusions :

1. For a 1000Hz signal it takes a while to ramp up and decide it's not silence.
2. For a 300Hz signal, it decides this immediately, because it sounds more like a real human voice.

Which is probably the reason why my 1000Hz signal had 280 ms latencies but the 2 second prelim 300Hz signal had a reasonable latency of 100 ms.  

SUMMARY 2.0 :

Sending 300 Hz seems to ramp it up faster, so anyway, it looks like the latencies are now down to between 80 and 100 ms which seems so much more reasonable. 
Next experiment, send ONLY 300 Hz, instead of 300 followed by 1Khz because we don't want to conflate two effects.
Second, I am eyeballing these delays manually. Get the program to work on that as well, for now my band pass filter fails on that data. It might be faster overall to eyeball it :)
