1. Use HTC phone.

- Vary interarrival distribution from the server.

Constant : usleep(100)
Poisson  :  -In(U)/Lambda
Square Wave pattern : Generate for 1 second, turn off for 1 second, Generate for 1 second turn off for 1 second and so on. Different duty cycles for the same rate, generates different burstiness. 

- Vary packet size. 

10, 100, 1000 

- Vary directionality ie server to client and client to server. 

2 variables 

- Vary arrival rate. 

10Hz, 100Hz


First :

1. Fix the arrival rate to 100Hz.
2. Vary the interarrival distribution.
3. Vary the packet sizes. 



Experiments :

1. Arrival rate at 100 Hz.

Pkt dist :

1. CBR
2. Poisson
3. Square wave at 25 %
4. Square wave at 50 %
5. Square wave at 75 %
6. Pareto with mean 10 ms and some arbitrary shape parameter. 

Change the whole thing to PKT_PADDING=100 and 250 apart from 1. 



The cross traffic experiment :

1. Control traffic 100 Hz and 200 byte payloads, and 100000 of these ie 15 minute experiments  
2. Background traffic : Long running traffic of variable bit rate but always CBR. Another experiment with TCP so that the window gets saturated. 
No port RR
      Baseline : no background            13:29 to 13:46
      200 bytes  @ 100 Hz  :   160 kbps   13:48 to 14:06 Double check, pretty sure 
      500 bytes  @ 100 Hz  :   400 kbps   14:15 to 14:32 
      1000 bytes @ 100 Hz  :   800 kbps   14:41 to 14:58
      1000 bytes @ 200 Hz  :   1.6 mbps   15:05 to 15:22
      1000 bytes @ 1000 Hz :   8   mbps   15:27 to 15:45
      TCP traffic : Rateless , capacity achieving code 
Background traffic, no limit on the number of packets received.
