1. Use HTC phone.

- Vary interarrival distribution from the server.

Constant : usleep(100)
Poisson  :  -In(U)/Lambda
Square Wave pattern : Generate for 1 second, turn off for 1 second, Generate for 1 second turn off for 1 second and so on. Different duty cycles for the same rate, generates different burstiness. 

- Vary packet size. 

10, 100, 1000 

- Vary directionality ie server to client and client to server. 

2 variables 

- Vary arrival rate. 

10Hz, 100Hz


First :

1. Fix the arrival rate to 100Hz.
2. Vary the interarrival distribution.
3. Vary the packet sizes.
