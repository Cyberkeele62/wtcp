1. Same Tang to Stata experiment.
2. The 4G was there all the way through which is nice.
3. There was close to no background stuff on the Nexus, which is awesome.
4. I had reverted it back to 100 Hz, 200 bytes on the Nexus, so this might test something.

5. The HTC phone logs can't be retrieved because I am not rooted.
