Can't believe I am doing this :

Main() :

nat routine to get IP address. 
spawn lte-receiver thread .
ethernet-sender logic here : keep sending packets after checking srtt before sending each packet. Maybe you want to check derivative as well.  

lte-receiver :
Send first packet
Spin in loop (waiting for packets)
Update srtt on every packet,


srtt smoothed receive rate etc are shared variables. There is no need for a mutex because only the receiver ever writes them.
