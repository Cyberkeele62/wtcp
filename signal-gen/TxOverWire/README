The next experiment after testing simple loopback retrieval. 

In the first experiment (August 17th), I was trying to see if I could pick out the individual components from the tx signal itself.
In the next one (August 18th), I actually transmit the signal over the wire into a recorder on another machine, and then see if I can pick out the components. 

This seems to work, although I need to do some work to slice the signal, and actually detect the peak. 

sig-proc.results has all the detected timings for each of the 10 pulses. 

Things seem to work with the following algorithm :

1. Tune using I-Q demodulation.
2. Do K-means clustering with K=10
3. pick mean of min and max as threshold.
4. Slice on the threshold.
5. Pick the first 1 as the starting point of the signal. 

So far, the tones used for the experiment are pure tones with no Gaussian noise added to them. The algorithm doesn't work as great with band limited Gaussian noise which I am going to address next.
